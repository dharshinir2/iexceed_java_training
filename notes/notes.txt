1.maximum value by integer in java?2power32 -1=2pow31
2.maximum value accomodated by a 8bit?256(0-255)2power8
wht is bit and byte?byte=8bit
what is number system

bigInt - to store large values
arg[]-hold value if we pass any value durig runtime(onlystring)
this is a obj for non static elements(same adress as the objects)
static variable's memory is same so it gets updated and value keeps changing
static ethod is executed before constructor during class loading time(only one time)
empt{}is also block aka instance block..it is before constructor after static
this is used a s a obj inside the class.we can also call the other methods of the class like normally
we can call paraeterized constructor by this keyword[this(1,1)]in normal constructor.but it should be prioritized that is given in first line
static methods or variables cannot be accessed with objects and this keyword
non static variable cannot be accesed or used inside a static function
higher order func is a func which takes another function as a argument

inheritance
-----------------
super keyword should be primary in the constructor(first)
super(name,age)--> name and age is passed to the base class and the remaning is for child class.
that means we can pass all the arguments to child and pass it to the parent
if we just use super() the default constructor is called(of parent)
this()same class constructor(can be parameterized)
we can assign values to the base class variables from child class by using superkeyword
eg super.name="Bee"
we cant use this and super in same block(both has to be primary)
base(child) object can be used to acces every elemets of parent class
can even modify the values too.
a obj of a class can used to every clss in their heirarchy.
consider 3 clases a,b and c.B's obj can access b and a.whereas c can access all the classes

overriding
--------
done with reference it is also known as dynamic method dispatch.it is run time
normally with different object is compile time
cannot overide final and static methods since static methods belong to the class



Abstraction
-----------
abstract methods comes inside abstract class
abstract clas shouldnt hav a object but can be extended and used by sub classes
uses @overide to define the abstract methods
eg @overide
public void display(int x .int y)
where display is a abstract method from a abstract class
every method of abstract cls should be overridden
can be overridden under the same @overideen annotation
this isnt good for developers so we 


upcasting
----------
calling the function of the superclass .its like type conversion in integers
 	b obj=new b();
      a obj2=(a)obj; 
      obj2.display(10,12);
here we are casting a as object like b


aggregation(composition) entity relationship
------------------------------
a object can be passed as a parameter to a class without extend or implement and the class methods can be assesed
it helps in forming a structure like multiple inheritance(which isnt in java)
this can be done for multiple classes too
----------------------------------
Day 3


multiple inheritance is not in java insted we go with interface

interface
----------------
interface acts like abstract class(only declarartion)
we can late have another class for defining the interface's methods.
implement can me use to join 2 or more classes or interface
extend ca also used to join a singular interface
variables inside interface are public ,static and final(can be accessed everywhere but cannot be update)

functonal interface
---------
if a interface has only one abstract method then its functional interface
represented by a annotation @functionalinterface

--------------------------------
DAY4


nested class
--------------
class insed class.better encapsulation.
nested class can also access the private elements of outerclass
the innerclass is static it can access only the static elements of the outer class.


DAY5

Multithreading
---------------------

threads are independent block of code.handling multiple threads all at once is called multithreading.

DAY6
------------
DATA STREAMS

Binary Array output/input stream

File Input/output stream

Object output and input stream

data output/input

buffered input
