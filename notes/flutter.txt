variable declaration

1.int x=9;
2.var x=9;(compilation time)x is int throughout the program
3.dynamic x=9(runtime) x datatype an be changed
4.num x=99;(num for numeric datatypes)

variable name schould be in camelcase (but starts with small letter)
num.runtimeType-> returns type

functional programing
uses to avoid shared mutable state


why we use functional programing?
to improve readability
easy for testing and debugging(making unit test more simple)
maintains concurrency(avoid race conditions )
less complexity
functions are self contained and predictable


dart treats function as first class citizen
reasons:
we can assign a func to variable or pass it to another function
and even we can return func from other functions





Based on the number of arguments it receive,the function is called as

0-> nullary function
1->unary
2->binary

if returns boolean then its called predicate function
